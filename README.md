# chrome-session-copy-plugin

Allows you to quickly copy all session data from one tab to another.

Enter your from and to url patterns on the extension options page, then open the extension popup in the extensions list in the top right of Chrome. Click the button and the data will be copied.

Match patterns for URLs: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns/

To go from www.a.com to localhost for instance, you would type \*://www.a.com/\* and \*://localhost/\*. You cannot specify the port for localhost.
